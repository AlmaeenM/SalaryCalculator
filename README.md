# SalaryCalculator
The SalaryCalculator.java file contains a #Java class named SalaryCalculator, which calculates the total salary based on the hourly rate and hours worked.

It prompts the user to input the hourly rate and hours worked using a Scanner object. Then, it calculates the base salary and overtime pay based on the given inputs. If the hours worked exceed 40, it considers the excess hours as overtime and calculates the overtime pay at a rate of 1.5 times the hourly rate for those hours. Finally, it prints the total salary.

The calculateSalary method within the class takes the hourly rate and hours worked as parameters and returns the total salary calculated using the given formula.
