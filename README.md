# SalaryCalculator
The Java application provided is meant to determine an employee's salary. The user is prompted to enter the number of hours worked and the hourly rate. The computer multiplies the hourly rate by the number of hours worked using this input to determine the base salary. The overtime rate, which is 1.5 times the hourly rate, is also determined by it. The computer determines the overtime hours by deducting 40 from the total number of hours worked if more than 40 hours are worked. The overtime hours multiplied by the overtime rate is then used to determine the overtime pay. Ultimately, the computer adds the base wage and overtime compensation to return the entire salary. 
The application offers a user-friendly interface for entering the necessary data by leveraging the Scanner class. It computes the salary precisely, taking into account both the regular hours worked and any overtime. The code is easy to integrate into any pay computation system and is both efficient and succinct.
